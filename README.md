## Lab 03 20.03.23

Plan for today in this order! :

### Tasks

- update my work from yesterday with the highlighted items from this mornings recap **done had lots of problems! took too long!!!**
- include in my html 2 lists a top 10 list and an unordered list about my work history **done**
- Add a 6th question to the guessing game, that takes a numeric display with a too high or to low alert with 4 attempts, and then telling the user the correct answer. **done**
- Add a 7th question that has multiple correct answers using an array, give them 6 attempts to get the correct answer, then display all possible correct answers, **done** _however could not get the code to work to if they input a letter_
- Keep track of the score **I have all ready done this!**

### Stretch Goals _unfortunatley did not get a chance to touch these_

- Attempt to make your code more DRY by putting all of the questions, answers, and responses to the first five yes/no questions into arrays (or even one huge multidimensional array), and modifying the game logic such that a ‘for’ loop will control the flow from question to question.
- Make the number-guessing question use a random number as its correct answer.
- There are some instructions that need doing in the _Setting Up the New Code 201 Project_ that need adding to my Repo
- Tidy up the CSS on the document, today or this evening. Concentrate on Header and Footer make em look pretty!
