      <h2>A Short Bio</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Steve and welcome to my humble slice of the internet pie!
      </p>

      <p>
        I have started a journey into coding which I am hoping is the begining
        of a new life and career! My work history is very varied, from selling
        wine, building a zoo, recruitment but more recently I have been working
        in hopsitality.
      </p>

      <p>
        I now have a family, and the late nights and working weekends was not
        the deal anymore. After having a long think about what I wanted to do I
        was drawn to the challenge and excitement of diving into the wonderful
        world of coding.
      </p>
